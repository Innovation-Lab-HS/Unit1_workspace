# About this Template
This Repo Template is designed to make it easy for students to move back and forth between VSCode on-line and VSCode on the desktop.  It also includes "Desktop-Lite" for the on-line VSCode deployment, which allows Java GUIs (or any other GUIs) to be displayed throught the browser event when they are being launched from a cloud VM. It also includes a handful of basic Java plugins for both VSCode on-line and VSCode desktop to help keep the environments consistent. Finially, it includes some .vscode setting to help hide some of this configuration noise from the students.

TODO: This template does not yet include a good example of a testing setup.
